        <h3>Christoph Burgdorf &mdash; <span>Using AngularJS for your regular website</span></h3>
        <p>At CouchCommerce Christoph helped to replace their old website with a new shiny AngularJS powered replacement. In his talk Christoph will shed light on the question if AngularJS is a good fit for regular websites or not. He will answer how they managed to built the website within 3 weeks considering that the two main actors had no experience with AngularJS before at all.

        <p>What also will be covered is how they tackled the challenges with SEO that come along with a client side architecture.</p>

        <p>If you are in doubt that AngularJS is a good fit for your regular website - this talk is for you!</p>
